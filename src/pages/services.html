            The goal of content and copywriting is <span class="highlight-yellow">TO SELL</span>. Too often, writers think the purpose is to keep the reader reading. But ultimately, you need to make a profit.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's what <span class="highlight-blue">I DIAGNOSE</span> What's your product's hook? What's the message? And what does the customer want?
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we've found your voice, the <span class="highlight-green">PRESCRIPTION</span> is simple: create phenomenal writing that fires up your reader's passion. Content that shows them why they just HAVE to buy your product. But, without the
            hard
            sell.
          <p>
            I'll also rank your content higher on a search engine results page. The higher your content ranks, the more traffic the content receives. And, I'll structure the content, title, headings, and even sentence length to best capture the
            reader's attention.

                  <span class="highlight-yellow">Copy </span>is any writing that speaks, persuades, or markets the product directly to the reader. Think product descriptions, social media posts, emails, newsletters, adverts, scripts, and more.

                <p>
                  Here <span class="highlight-yellow">every word counts</span>. Copy needs rhythm. It must compel. It should distil your message down to its raw, potent source... and get that sale. If you've got a product to sell, I'll find the words
                  to sell it.
